# Privacy Policy for LasTG

Effective Date: August 01, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how LasTG ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). Our application is designed to be a simple tool and does not collect or store your personal data beyond what is necessary for its immediate functionality.

# Information We Access (With Your Permission)
To provide its core functionality, our Service requests the following permissions:
* Read Call Log (android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG): We use this permission solely to identify the most recent phone call. This allows the application to retrieve the phone number from that call. This data is processed locally on your device to identify if the number is unknown to you.
* Read Contacts (android.permission.READ_CONTACTS): We use this permission to check if the phone number from the most recent call already exists in your contact list. This helps us determine if the call was from an unknown number. This data is processed locally on your device.

# How We Use This Information
The phone number obtained from the recent call log (if determined to be unknown by checking against your contacts) is used only for the following purpose:
* To generate a link that allows you to open a chat with this phone number in the Telegram application, if you choose to do so.

# Data Storage and Transfer
* No Data Storage: We do not save, store, or record any phone numbers, call log details, contact information, or any other personal data on your device persistently or on any external servers. The information accessed is used ephemerally (for the immediate task) and is discarded after the application's current session or action is completed.
* No Data Transfer: We do not transmit your call log data, contact data, or the identified phone number to our servers or any third-party services. The processing occurs entirely locally on your device.

# Third-Party Services
Our Service does not integrate with or use any third-party SDKs or services that would collect data from you (e.g., analytics, advertising networks).

# Data Security
While we do not store your personal data, we handle the temporary access to your call log and contacts with care, operating strictly within the permissions you grant. All processing is done locally on your device.

#Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly access or process any information that could identify children. If you believe we might have inadvertently processed such information, please contact us.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
